## Build

This section explains important pieces to build and extend the project.

### AI

- Purpose: Provide optional empathetic conversational support, suggested coping techniques, and personalized recommendations.
- Suggested approach:
  - Use a hosted LLM or an API-based conversational model (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) with clear system prompts for empathy and safety.
  - Keep all AI interactions optional and clearly labeled; never present AI as a substitute for professional care.
  - Implement rate-limiting, input sanitization, and content filters to avoid harmful outputs.
  - Consider fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over a vetted knowledge base of mental health resources.
- Example components:
  - ai/
    - agent.js (or agent.py) — handles requests to the model
    - prompts/ — system/user prompt templates
    - rAG/ — vector store and retrieval logic
  - pipelines for moderation and logging (ensure privacy controls)

### Resources

- Curate a resource library with verified sources:
  - WHO, CDC, National mental health organizations
  - Local crisis hotlines (configurable by region)
  - Articles, videos, and guided exercises
- Store resources in JSON/Markdown files or a small CMS for easy updates, e.g.:
  - resources/
    - readme.md
    - local_hotlines.json
    - articles/
- Accessibility: ensure text alternatives, readable font sizes, and keyboard navigation.

### About

- Purpose: Explain project goals, scope, and limitations.
